This is not visible, because they are of the same type, but an performance
issue. A variable indentation-tree-debug was introduced to show double drawn
overlays (as well shows active ace-jump and org source blocks).

** DONE Fixing ace-jump mode leads to breaking org-babel
CLOSED: [2014-04-01 Tue 10:36]
- deleting overlays seems to be problematic
- better save branches and draw only necessary stuff
** TODO bugs when only \n on line and multiple |
- overlays don't see each other and add up
